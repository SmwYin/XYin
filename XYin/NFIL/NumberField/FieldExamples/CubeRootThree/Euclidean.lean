# `ℚ(∛3)` Euclidean

Euclidean or non-Euclidean properties and their arithmetic consequences.

This file is part of the reorganized `FieldExamples` case-study layout. The core files are
intended to import almost linearly:
`Basic → Galois → Embeddings → RingOfIntegers → Discriminant → PrimeSplitting →
ClassGroup → Units → Euclidean → LocalGlobal`, with a few field-specific special-topic files
kept separate.

/-- `ℚ(∛3)` is norm-Euclidean: division with remainder in `ℤ[θ]` with respect to the absolute
value of the field norm. This is a classical result for the pure cubic field of smallest
discriminant, and strengthens `isPrincipalIdealRing`. -/
